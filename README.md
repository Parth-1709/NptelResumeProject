# AI-Assisted Resume Evaluator (ATS-Style Scoring System)

A web-based **ATS-style resume evaluation system** that analyzes a candidate’s resume against a given job description and generates a **transparent, explainable compatibility score** with actionable improvement suggestions.

This project was developed as part of an **NPTEL Internship** and focuses on **deterministic scoring logic** rather than black-box decision making.
